SpriteSet?

Eventing
  add eventing to layers and more eventing to elements
  replacement for setTimeout / setInterval?

update documentation for imported gfx classes

rotate over time - done?

Scrollable layers
  scroll to point - done?
  documentation!

is there a way of dimming layers without clearing the layer?
- also use internal time instead of setTimeout - use replacement in common eventing system?

support for turning mouse tracking off - done?

remove all elements - done?

pix element?

Known Issues:
If GfxElement is flipped horizontally or vertically, rotation will be reversed.
If flipped both horizontally and vertically, rotation will be as normal.
